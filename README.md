<h1>Smart Stick for Blind</h1>

<h4> Description</h4>
<ul>
<li> Main aim of project was to create a stick for blind so that it is affordable and at the same time reliable</li>
<br>
<li> A smart stick basically detects the obstacles around it in 3 directions (right, left and front) and users are notfied using the android App.</li>
<br>
<li> The smart stick uses 3 ultrasonic sensors and arduino to detect obstacles around it.</li>
<br> 
<li> The Android app takes the data from the stick and provides feedback to the user in the form of voice output.</li>
<li> Since, blind people find difficult to operate the app, the app launches automatically as soon as it is connected to the smart stick</li>
<li> There is a Navigation feature wherein the user has to say the destination by voice and GPS will start automatically (The current location will be detected automatically).</li>
<li> In order to consider the emergency, and for proper navigation amongst the app, gestures are used. The user draws some gestures lik (^) or (v) or / on the screen and appropriate person will be notified about the situation</li>
<li> The gestures are editable and people phone numbers can be set</li>
</ul>

Our main aim was basically to solve a real world problem as well as do something good for the society.

This project was Final year Engineering project.
